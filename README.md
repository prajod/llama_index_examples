This repo shows how to use the [Table Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/table-transformer) and GPT4-V api from OpenAI to extract information from tables inside pdf files. It also uses the Qdrant vector DB for storing embeddings. 
The code in this repo  is derived from the [llamaindex examples github page](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/multi_modal/multi_modal_pdf_tables.ipynb). Here I have removed all the code from that example except for the table transformer + GPT4-V code. Also refactored the code to removed unused libraries and python packages. Also fixed a bug in the code that caused a file not found error, when a specific folder was not created. See the Table transformer repo to understand how it works.
